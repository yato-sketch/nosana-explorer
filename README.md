## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version 16 or higher is recommended).

### Setup

Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server locally at `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev
```

Nuxt provides hot reloading, so changes will be reflected immediately without restarting the server.

## Build for Production

Build the application for production use:

``bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build
```

Once built, you can locally preview the production build using:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview

```
### Lint & Format Code

To keep your code clean and consistent, you can run linting and formatting checks:

```bash
# Lint
npm run lint

# Format
npm run format
```

## Deployment

After building, you can deploy the `dist/` directory to any static hosting service. For more detailed deployment steps, refer to the [Nuxt 3 deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment).
